1- import the following libraries (NumPy, Pandas)

2- use the following code to import iris_dataset
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

3- Convert the dataset to DataFrames

4- from the target column, drop all records with 
the class 'virginica'

5- Split the dataset into X (features) and y (target)

6- split the dataset into (Train & Test) Sets and make 
the test set size 30%
Use the following command:
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
Hint: Split it into X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test

7- Import Knn Algorithm and adjust 
its parameters (n_neighbors, weights, algorithm, p
if you are using
minkowsky metric and metric)
Hint: from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=7, weights = 'distance', algorithm='brute_force', metric='euclidean')

8- Fit your data X_train, y_train into the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

9- predict the labels of X_test
Hint: model.predict()

10- Score the model for the training & testing performance
Hint: model.score(predicted_x, y)
