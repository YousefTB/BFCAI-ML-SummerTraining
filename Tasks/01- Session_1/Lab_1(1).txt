1- write 3 variable and check for it's data types using type() function

2- write 3 variable and take it in one line using split() function and print it

3- write program take number from user then convert it to string " casting " then print lenth of this string using len() function

4- you have number and you want to remove last k number from this number implement python program do that and print result

5- take integer multiple number in one line using map and split then print maximum and minimum number from it using min and max function 

6- Write a program that reads an integer salary then:

	If salary < 1000,
	-	Print you are poor
	elif salary greater than or equal to 1000 and less than 20000
