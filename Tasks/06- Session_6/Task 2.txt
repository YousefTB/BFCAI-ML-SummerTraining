1- Import Logistic Regression and adjust its parameters (C, penalty, solver, max_iter)
Hint: from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
Hint: Solvers
['liblinear': a good choice for small datasets]
['lbfgs': Limited Memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm, good for multiclass]
['newton-cg': Quasi-newton method]
['sag': stochastic gradient descent]
['saga': stochastic gradient descent with l1 regularization]

2- Fit your data X_train, y_train into the model

3- predict the labels of X_test
Hint: model.predict()

4- Score the model for the training & testing performance
Hint: model.score(predicted_x, y)
