First: Use diabetes dataset to be used in Regression problem
Hint: from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes

Second: Implement the following
1- Use the dataset as Dataframe
Hint: df = load_diabetes(as_frame = True)

2- Split the dataframe into X and y which X has the features and y has the NUMERICAL LABEL
Hint: from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
Hint: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.3)

3- Import and use the Linear Regression Model
Hint: from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

4- Import and use the Lasso regression model and enhance its parameter (alpha, max_iter) that regularize the model
Hint:
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso


5- Import and use the Ridge regression model and enhance its parameter (alpha, max_iter, solver) that regularize the model
Hint:
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
Hint: Solvers
['lsqr': regularized least-squares]
['sag':
stochastic gradient descent]
['saga': unbiased version of sag]

6- fit the X_train, y_train into each model

Hint: model.fit(X_train, y_train)



7- evaluate each model to see its performance

Hint: model.score(X_test, y_test)
