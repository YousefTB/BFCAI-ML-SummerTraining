1- use wine dataset to cluster
Hint: from sklearn.datasets import load_wine
Hint: X,y = load_wine(return_X_y = True)

2- Make an empty list

3- make a range of numbers for the No. of clusters 
and assign in to variable
(choose the range to start from 1 to n; n of your choose)

4- use K-Means from sklearn
Hint: from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

5- use for loop to try different number of k
using the variable you created and stored the range

6- Make an object of the KMeans and adjust 
its parameters (n_clusters, max_iter)
Hint: km = KMeans()

7- Fit your data X into the model
Hint: km.fit(X)

8- Score your model for the current number of k and store the result
in the list
Hint: lst.append(km.intertia_)

9- using matplotlib, plot the score for each number of k
Hint: use plt.plot() function
Hint: first parameter is the x-axis values which
will be the k values you used
Hint: second parameter is the y_axis values which
will be the costs of each k stored in the list

10- make another model as kmeans and train it
for the best value of k you have accomplished
Hint: km2 = KMeans(n_clusters = best k you accomplished)

11- predict the cluster for each record
Hint: prediction = km2.predict(X)

12- print the prediction
