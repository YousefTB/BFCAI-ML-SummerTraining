1- use wine dataset to cluster
Hint: from sklearn.datasets import load_wine
Hint: X,y = load_wine(return_X_y = True)

2- Split your X,y into train & test
Hint: from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y, test_size=0.3)

3- Implement the decision tree and MultinomialNB
and adjust its parameters if you want to.
Hint:
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

5- fit your X_train,y_train into your models
Hint: model.fit(X_train, y_train)

6- score your model, once for train and the second for test sets
Hint: model.score(X_train,y_train)
Hint: model.score(X_test,y_test)

7- Import Bagging Classifier
Hint: from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier

8- Create the bagging classifier MultinomialNB
and adjust the number of estimator [n_estimators]
Hint: Bag = BaggingClassifier(yourModel, n_estimators=100)

9- fit your X_train,y_train into your BaggingClassifier
Hint: Bag.fit(X_train,y_train)

10- Score your bagging, once for train and the second for test sets
Hint: Bag.score(X_train,y_train)
Hint: Bag.score(X_test,y_test)

11- Import Random Forest model
Hint: from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

12- Create the random forest with your chosen parameters
[n_estimators, criterion]
Hint: RF = RandomForestClassifier()

13- fit your X_train,y_train into your Random Forest

14- Score your Random Forest, once for train 
and the second for test sets
