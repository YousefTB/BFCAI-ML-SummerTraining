1- Import AdaBoost technique
Hint: from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier

2- Create AdaBoostClassifier with MultinomialNB
and adjust the No. of estimators and learning rate
[n_estimators, learning_rate]

3- fit your X_train,y_train into AdaBoostClassifier

4- Score your Adaboost, once for train and the second for test sets
