1- Import Support Vector Machine Classifier and adjust its parameters (C, kernel)
Hint: from sklearn.svm import SVC

2- Fit your data X_train, y_train into the model

3- predict the labels of X_test
Hint: model.predict()

4- Score the model for the training & testing performance
Hint: model.score(predicted_x, y)
