1- Import Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm
Hint: from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
Also try
MultinomialNB
BernoulliNB

2- Fit your data X_train, y_train into the model

3- predict the labels of X_test
Hint: model.predict()

4- Score the model for the training & testing performance
Hint: model.score(predicted_x, y)
