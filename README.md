## Machine Learning Content
All PDFs that contain the content of machine learning as each session about specific topics are marked from `01` to `08` in total of 8 sessions.

- **First Session:** *Intro to Machine Learning*, this session gives a good shot into Machine Learning and its branches, and which tools will be used through the training.
  
- **Second Session:** *Data Management and Visualization*, the most important techniques through the Data Science and Machine Learning are how to handle data in the Big Data Era, so how to make Programming to take the responsibility for handling data. also, how to explore data and extract useful information and knowledge using graphs.
  
- **Third Session:** *Data Analysis and Preprocessing*, how to get over the hidden patterns in the data, and how to deal with all data problems such as missing values, outliers and noises, and to know the different distributions of the data and how to treat it.
  
- **Fourth Session:** *Supervised Machine Learning (Classification) Part-1*, get to know the different types of classification models, such as K-Nearest Neighbors and how it works, and the hyperparameters of the algorithm. as the same for Decision Tree algorithm, one of the powerful learning algorithms.
  
- **Fifth Session:** *Supervised Machine Learning (Classification) Part-2*, continue the journey of the Machine Learning Classification algorithms, one of them that depends on the probabilities that is Naive Bayes model, and the most powerful machine learning algorithm that is Support Vector Machine.
  
- **Sixth Session:** *Supervised Machine Learning (Regression)*, moving into the prediction of the numerical output using Regression technique, the types of regression and methods that OPTIMIZE the error generated by the regression.
  
- **Seventh Session:** *Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering)*, getting started with the second type of machine learning that is Unsupervised Learning, what it is used for, how it works and the types of it such as Clustering. one of the clustering technique called K-Means.
  
- **Eighth Session:** *Advanced Machine Learning and Intro to Deep Learning*, that is about how to deal with different problems that we would face through the journey of Machine learning and how to solve it. the second part is how the deep learning started and how it improved.

You can find some helping `Jupyter Notebooks` for each session to assest your understanding.

## Assets
This folder contains all helping materials that you may need through the study of the Machine Learning, such as `Python Sheets`, `Pandas Sheets` and `NumPy Sheets`, you can also recall some different *Datasets* uploaded to practice what is discussed in the content of ML.

All uploaded folders is used for practicing on *Python* for the beginners, or different kind of libraries and packages such as *Pandas*, *NumPy* or *Matplotlib*.

## Tasks
This secion contains all tasks associated with each session, which help you to assest your understanding and cover the practicality part of the machine learning, all hints exist for each task to help you practice.

**NOTE !** The second session tasks is the same sheets for *Pandas*, *NumPy* and *Matplotlib* which you will find in the assets folder.

## ML Projects
Open-source Machine Learning projects that is applied on different types of datasets which you can practice and gain knowledge from different mindsets and how they solve it, you can add your projects for sharing.
